The Aspect Definition Language (ADL) is a language for
defining the classification, attributes and values of
arbitrary data objects. The language is extensible,
as are objects defined using the language. Contextual
extension (sometimes called Aspects or views) is also
supported. The syntax is free-form, except inside value
literals. Whitespace and newlines are considered as
equivalent to a single space and are ignored. A comment
(beginning with //) continues to the end of line and
is considered as white-space.

</tr>

<tr>
<th align="right" valign="top">Object</th>
<td valign="top">
<p>
Everything in ADL is an Object, including the
top supertype which is called "Object".
Any named object may have subtype objects,
so there is no distinction between types (classes)
and instances. Any object may also contain child
objects.
</p>
<td valign="top">
Object is built-in. Foo is a subtype of Object.
<pre>
Object:;
Foo: Object;
</pre>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th align="right" valign="top" width="10%">Parent</th>
<td valign="top">
<p>
Every Object has a value assigned to its Parent variable,
except the TOP object, which serves as the outermost
parent. The ADL builtin objects belong the TOP object.
Variables (including Parent) may not be re-assigned.
TOP and Object are built-in. We'll indicate others as
we procede.
</p>
</td>
<td valign="top">
<p>
You normally won't see TOP. This is because each
file (including the built-in definitions) normally
creates its own namespace, and subsequent files
descend inside the last object from the previous
file.
</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th align="right" valign="top" width="10%">Name</th>
<td valign="top">
<p>
An Object may have a Name, which can be one or
more words.  A word is an sequence of alphanumeric
or underscore characters, and may even start with
a digit, so <strong>42</strong> is a valid Name.
The amount of whitespace between the words may vary
and is considered equivalent to a single space.
</p>
<p>
An object may also be anonymous, for purposes described
below.  Each Name is unique within a given Parent,
but anonymous objects are unrestricted.
</p>
<td valign="top">
Declare an object called Person. It has Object for
a supertype. Its parent depends on the context of
this declaration.
<pre>Person:
</pre>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th align="right" valign="top">New Objects</th>
<td valign="top">
<p>
An object is declared using colon <b>:</b>
after the name (if any) followed by the name
of its Super (supertype object).  If no supertype
name is given, the supertype is Object.
The supertype name is found in the current parent
(searching that parent's supertypes) or in an
enclosing parent, up to TOP.
</p>
</td>
<td valign="top">
Declare an object called Employee with supertype Person:
<pre>
Employee: Person;
</pre>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th align="right" valign="top">Children</th>
<td valign="top">
Any Object may have one or more child objects.
</p>
<p>
A single child object may be created by declaring
it following a dot "." after the name of its parent,
or by opening the Aspect (namespace) of the parent
between braces (curly brackets), and declaring
children separated by semi-colons. The semi-colon
is not required before or after a closing brace.
</p>
</td>
<td valign="top">
Declare two child objects for Person. Each is a
subtype of the built-in variable String (described below).
<pre>
Person.Family Name: String;
Person: {
    Given Name: String[];
}
</pre>
</tr>

<tr>
<th align="right" valign="top">Re-opening</th>
<td valign="top">
<p>
An object that is already defined cannot be redefined.
Using the same name again with the same parent will
re-open the existing object. If the supertype is
provided it must match the existing definition; the
supertype cannot be changed.
An object with no name cannot be referenced so cannot
be re-opened.
</p>
<td valign="top">
We saw this in the previous example. Person was re-opened
to add Given Name.
<pre>
Employee {
    Employee Number: Integer;
}
</pre>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th align="right" valign="top">Extension</th>
<td valign="top">
Any existing named object may be re-opened to allow
adding more children - just use its name without
re-declaring its supertype, and add the new children
in a brace-list, or after the "." operator.
</td>
<td valign="top">
<pre>
Person: {
    Given Name: String {
	Max Length = 48;
    }[];
}
Person {	// Re-open Person to extend it
    Family Name: String;
}
// Re-open Person.Family Name to set Max Length
Person.Family Name.Max Length = 24;
</pre>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th align="right" valign="top" width="10%">Anonymity</th>
<td valign="top">
<p>
The object name is optional, which allows anonymous objects.
An anonymous object cannot subsequently be re-opened
or used as a supertype, so it is complete at the time
of its declaration.
</td>
<td valign="top">
<p>
Declare an anonymous object which is a subtype of
Person. Given Names is an array, so the assigned value
must also be an Array, declared using square brackets.
<pre>
: Person {
    Given Name = ['John'];
    Family Name = 'Smith';
}
</pre>
</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th align="right" valign="top">Eponymous Naming</th>
<td valign="top">
<p>
As a special case, if just a name (no colon) is
used, and the name is of a Object that's not
already a child of this object, and the Object
is not being re-opened (by { or .), then a new
child is created having the same name as the
supertype. This is called eponymous naming.
</p>
</td>
<td valign="top">
<p>
If Date is an existing type, the following
declares that an Event has a variable whose
name and supertype are both Date.
</p>
<pre>
Event: {
    Date
}
: Event { Date = 2001-03-19 }
</pre>
<p>
This has the same effect as declaring
<pre>
Date: Date;
</pre>
Note that the supertype reference works in
this case because it has not yet been defined
locally, but if it had, a preceding dot would
force an explicit up traversal.
</p>
</td>

<tr>
<th align="right" valign="top">Variables</th>
<td valign="top">
<p>
Any Object with a value syntax allows value assignment,
so serves as a variable.  Any parent (including by
inheritance) of such an object may contain one assignment
to that variable. The variable may also contains one
assignment to itself, which serves as a default value.

A number of variables are provided, or you can define
your own. Just assign the Syntax variable of your object
and it becomes a variable which accepts a value matching
that syntax.
</p>
<p>
Syntax accepts a Regular Expression. Regular Expression
also has a syntax, but that syntax is not regular (cannot
be described by a Regular Expression), so it is a special
built-in.
</p>
<p>
Reference is also a special Variable. Assignment to a
Reference requires an ADL path name for an object. See below.
</p>
</td>
<td valign="top">
These are the true built-in variables:
<pre>
Regular Expression:;
Object {
    Syntax: Regular Expression;

The following are provided, but are not true built-ins:
<pre>
String:;
Number:;
    Integer: Number;
    Decimal: Number;

Regular Expressions in ADL open and close with the
<strong>/</strong> character. They provide a specific

<li> grouping using <strong>(...)</strong> </li>
<li> character escapes prefixed by a <strong>\</strong> character: <strong>0befntr\*+?()|/[</strong> </li>

Integer.Syntax = /[-+]?[1-9][0-9]*/;
Decimal.Syntax =
  /[-+]?(0|[1-9][0-9]*)(\.[0-9]*)?/;

<td valign="top">
<p>
Any object that contains a variable (or that <strong>is</strong>
a variable), or whose supertypes contain a variable that
it inherits, may contain one Assignment to that variable.
An Assignment is a special anonymous child object
that associates a Value with that variable for that Parent
object. Assignment has its own syntax, and cannot be
declared using the usual object definition syntax.
</p>
<p>
If an assignment is inherited, a local assignment overrides it.
If a variable has neither a local nor inherited assignment,
the value of that variable is undefined for that object.
</p>
<td valign="top">
Here's an anonymous Employee object, with assignments to
variables, including inherited Person variables. Each
element of an Array value conforms to the syntax for
that type of value.
<pre>

    Family Name = 'Smith';
    Given Name = ['John'];
    Employee Number = 42317;
}
</pre>
Here's a variable with an assignment to itself:
<pre>
Forty Two: Integer = 42;

The variable Forty Two has an assignment to Forty Two
(itself) with the value 42.

The Assignments in the previous example were Final.
If this object was named and had a subtype, the subtype
inherits these assignments, but it cannot re-assign
those variables. Assignment to Reference variables has
a special version of this rule.
</p>
<p>However, it's also possible that an assignment is
tentative by defining it using the tentative assignment
operator <strong>~=</strong>.  A tentative assignment
may be re-assigned in a subtype or in another Context.

<tr>
<th align="right" valign="top">Values</th>
<td valign="top">

As discussed, each variable has an associated Syntax
for literal values. This syntax is used when processing
an Assignment to that variable. If the variable is
declared to be an array, the values are separated
by commas and enclosed in square brackets (whitespace
around these is skipped).
</p>
<td valign="top">
Note that the syntax for a regular expression
cannot be encoded using the allowed syntax
for regular expressions, since it is not
itself regular. It's built-in.

</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th align="right" valign="top">Reference Variables</th>
<td valign="top">
<p>
The built-in variable Reference allows assigning
a reference to another Object. The Syntax for the
value of a Reference is the syntax defined for
object names.
</p>
<p>
There is a special rule for assigning to a Reference
that already has a Final assignment. Any subtype of
the type in the existing assignment may be assigned.
This creates a further restriction that does not
violate the finality of the previous assignment.
The default assignment for all References is Object,
and that assignment is final. However, any subtype
of Reference may assign a more restricted type.
</p>
<td valign="top">
<p>
Employment is between a Company and a Person,
and that's final (a Company cannot employ a Dog).
Every value in the Project array must be a Project.

<tr>
<th align="right" valign="top">Reference Shorthand</th>
<td valign="top">
<p>
There is a short-hand syntax for defining Reference
subtypes and their arrays, using <b>-&gt;</b> and
<b>=&gt;</b>. Eponymous naming of reference variables
is also allowed, see the description above.
</p>
<td>
<p>
Here, each Employment has a reference to one
company (as Employer), to one Person (as Employee)
and to an array of zero or more Projects (this
variable uses eponymous naming). Any assignment
to these variables must conform to the type of
the implied Reference.
<pre>
Employment: {
    Employer -> Company;
    Employee -> Person;
    => Project;
}

<tr>
<th align="right" valign="top">Enumerations</th>

Reference short-hand provides a nice way to handle
enumerations, such as the built-in Boolean.

Boolean is built-in, declared like this:
<pre>
Enumeration: Object;
Boolean: Enumeration;
True: Boolean;
False: Boolean;
Boolean{Is Sterile = True}

Making an object Sterile prevents definition of any
further subtypes. It is however possible to have a

<tr>
<th align="right" valign="top">Resolving Names</th>
<td valign="top">
<p>
When an object name is used as a reference or as a
supertype, and is not present within the current
context, the supertype context is searched first.
This search is recursive. If the name is still not
found, the same search proceeds in the parent object,
which is implicit traversal.
If the object is found, a following dot may be used
to search inside it, but after traversing down like
this, following searches will not ever traverse to
the object's parent, even though that name might
be usable from that object.
</p>

<td valign="top">
Here Product is defined in the current scope.
Then in the Retail object, we define Toaster to be
a Product - referring to Product as it was defined
in the Parent's scope. Finally after returning to
the top scope, we traverse the Retail space again
to assign the Toaster a Price.
<pre>
Product: {
    Name: String;
    Price: Decimal {
	Syntax = /$[1-9]+\.[0-9][0-9]/

If a Name is present in an object, but also in a
parent object, a reference to the parent object
is still possible. Prefix the name by its parent's
name, and the search will find the parent first.
Otherwise, prefix the name by one or more dots.
Each dot starts the search one level further up,
and prevents the search from stepping any further up.
The local object (and inherited objects) will be
ignored, and the search will start at the parent.
</p>

<td valign="top">
Without the ability to traverse up, the definition
of Alternate would create a second reference to the
eponymous Product variable inside Sale Item,

You can define new subtypes of variable,

Inherited assignments to hidden variables are also hidden.
Aliasing changes what is seen in the subtype, it
doesn't change the supertype's child.

<tr>
<th align="right" valign="top">Contextual Extension</th>
<td valign="top">
<p>
We've seen what happens when an object is re-opened
from the same parent where it was defined. However
when a namespace traversal is used to re-open it,
there are two possibilities for any changes:
<ul>
<li> Make the changes to the original object,
<li> Make changes that are only seen from the
point of view (the Context) of the place where
the object was re-opened. From other places,
the object will still appear unchanged.
</ul>
This latter case is called Contextual Extension.
The context object provides a point-of-view,
which is the Aspect. The objects visible from
that Aspect (whether base objects or contextual
extensions) are collectively the Facets of that
Aspect.  This is the reason that this language
is called Aspect Definition Language.
</p>

<p>
As discussed, there are two kinds of namespace
traversal.  When a name is found in a parent
or some further ancestor, that's a traversal.
If the object is reopened by <strong>{...}</strong>
at this point, any changes will be made to its
original definition. This also works when
traversing down to a child using a dot.
</p>

<p>
However if the traversal <strong>ends</strong>
with a dot, then any changes will be contextual -
only visible from the context where the traversal
starts.	 The contextual definitions (objects,
variables, aliases, or assignments) have a Context
value which indicates this starting point. All
objects actually have a Context, but for most,
it's the same as the Parent.
</p>
</td>
<td valign="top">
<p>
A new variable called Ordinal is added to Integer.
This is a normal extension, not contextual.
The object called 3 (an Integer assigned the value
3 - the object is distinct from the value here)
is given the Ordinal 'third'.  Now German opens
a new context. The assignment to 3.Ordinal has a
dot at the end of the name, so in the German
context, 3 uses the verbalisation "dritte".
In all other contexts, 3 still uses "third".
</p>
<pre>
Integer {
    Ordinal: String;
}
3: Integer {
    Ordinal ~= "third";
} = 3;
German: {
    3.Ordinal. = "dritte";
}
</pre>

<p>
Here's another case. Two variables are defined to
carry the names of two operations. In the German
context, the two names are different.
</p>
<pre>
OperationNames:
{
    Insert : String ~= "Insert";
    Delete : String ~= "Delete";
}

German:
{
    OperationNames {
        Insert. ~= "Einfügen";
        Delete. ~= "Löschen";
    }

In New Context, Person.Surname is called Family Name,

Note that joe smith's Given Name is assigned Final.
</p>

Back in the top context for these declarations,
New Context is re-opened and the Family Name 'Smith'

re-assigned. Note that from the point of view of
New Context, joe smith is still has a Family name of
Smith (this assignment applies) but from the
